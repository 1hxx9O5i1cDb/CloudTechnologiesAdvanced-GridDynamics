### GCP Cloud Function with Pub/Sub and Cloud Storage

This task involves deploying a Cloud Function that processes messages from a Pub/Sub topic and stores them in a Cloud Storage bucket.

#### Key Points:

1. **Automatic Bucket Creation for Cloud Function Updates**:

- Every time the Cloud Function is updated, GCP automatically creates a new Cloud Storage bucket to store the function code if one doesn't already exist.

2. **Environment Variables Issue**:

- The environment variable `BUCKET_NAME`, used to specify the target bucket, may not work due to the default service account having insufficient permissions.

3. **Pub/Sub Subscription with Push**:

- When using a Pub/Sub topic as an event trigger for your Cloud Function, a Pub/Sub subscription with a push configuration is automatically created. You don't need to manually create the subscription.

#### How to Package and Deploy the Function Code (JavaScript Example):

1. **Package the JavaScript Code**:

To package your code for deployment, navigate to the directory containing `index.js` and `package.json` and run:

```bash
zip function_code.zip index.js package.json
```

2. **Upload and Deploy with Terraform**:

Use Terraform to deploy the Cloud Function and set up the infrastructure.

Run the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

3. **Send a Test Message to Pub/Sub**:

To test the function, send a message to the Pub/Sub topic using the following command:

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics publish message-topic --message="Grid Dynamics"
```

4. **Check Cloud Storage**:

Once the message is processed, the function will create a new file in the specified Cloud Storage bucket with the content of the message.

This setup allows messages to be sent to Pub/Sub, automatically triggering a function that processes and stores them in Cloud Storage.
